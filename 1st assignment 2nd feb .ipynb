We then use the three in-built methods keys(), values(), and items() to display the dict_keys, dict_values, and dict_items view objects, respectively. The keys() method returns the keys of the dictionary as a dict_keys view object, the values() method returns the values of the dictionary as a dict_values view object, and the items() method returns the key-value pairs of the dictionary as a dict_items view object. Finally, we print the three view objects to the console to verify that they have been created correctly."
